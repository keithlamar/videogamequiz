She first appeared in Super Mario Land as the game's damsel in distress, a role usually played by Princess Peach. Since her appearance in Mario Tennis, she has become a staple playable character in the Mario spin-off games, in which she is often paired up with Peach. It is often speculated that she is Luigi's love interest. Her official description for Mario Party 4 states that Luigi has a crush on her, but Waluigi does too, which may cause trouble."
